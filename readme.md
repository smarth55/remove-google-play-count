## Remove Google Play Count

Do you suffer from anxiety whenever you see the play counts of songs in Google Play Music? Do you feel bad about listening to some songs more than others? Why didn't you listen to the whole album? Is there something wrong with the other songs? Now, do you feel obligated to listen to them just so that you can see the same number for each song?

How about you stop worrying by hiding the play count and just relax.
